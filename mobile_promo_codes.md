# How to use Promo Codes on Android:

1. Generate new Promo Codes for the new app version. Open Google Developer Console (https://play.google.com/apps/publish/), select your app. Then go to `User Acquisition` -> `Promotion` -> `Add New Promotion`;
2. When done, save the promotion codes file;
3. To send the user a promotion code, just copy one of them from the file, and add it to the end of the URL:

```https://play.google.com/store?code=```

You should have something like this:

```https://play.google.com/redeem?code=bvlkfdxkjghlkgdhlkj```

4. Share that URL with the user. He will be able to activate it with the link;
5. When promo-subscription ends, the user will be moved to a paid one, just like after the regular trial.
